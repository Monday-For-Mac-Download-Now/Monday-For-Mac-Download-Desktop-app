2. Open **Terminal** on your Mac, paste the copied command, and press `Return`.
3. Enter your macOS password when prompted and confirm the installation steps in Terminal.
4. After the command completes, open **Applications** → **Monday** and launch.

> **Note:** The terminal command above simply downloads the official installer file and places it in your `Applications` folder — it does not alter system security settings. If Gatekeeper prevents opening, go to **System Preferences → Security & Privacy → General** and click **Allow** for Monday.
